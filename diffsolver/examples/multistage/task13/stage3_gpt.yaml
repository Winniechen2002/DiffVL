    There are 6 objects called 'small1', 'small2', 'small3', 'big1', 'big2', 'big3'. 
    Grasp the object small3 and move the object small3 to the goal place.
    Make sure other objects are keeping theirs place.
    Make sure small3 is keeping its shape.
    tkeep is better than tlast except using away.
