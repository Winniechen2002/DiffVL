    There are 6 objects called 'small1', 'small2', 'small3', 'big1', 'big2', 'big3'. 
    Grasp the object small2 and move the object small2 to the goal place.
    Make sure other objects are keeping theirs place.
    Make sure small2 is keeping its shape.
    tkeep is better than tlast except using away.
